Once selected, these options determine how to fulfill these orders. For example, what carrier and service to use, what package or packages to use, what warehouse to ship from, when to dispatch the shipment, etc. When ShipperHQ is used to produce shipping rates and options, it will determine many of these elements as part of its rating calculations. The Insights API gives you access to all of those details so that you can integrate them into your application.","sidebar":"ShippingInsights"},"insight/place-order":{"id":"insight/place-order","title":"PlaceOrder Mutation","description":"How Rating + Shipping Insights Works with the PlaceOrder mutation","sidebar":"ShippingInsights"},"insight/quickstart":{"id":"insight/quickstart","title":"Insights API Quickstart","description":"This document is intended for technical architects and developers that need to integrate with ShipperHQ\u2019s Shipping Insights API to build their own integration to retrieve shipment details from ShipperHQ.","sidebar":"ShippingInsights"},"label/faq":{"id":"label/faq","title":"Label FAQ","description":"Is the Label API available?","sidebar":"Label"},"label/how-label-works":{"id":"label/how-label-works","title":"How Label Work","description":"Early Access Program","sidebar":"Label"},"label/overview":{"id":"label/overview","title":"Label API Overview","description":"The Label API enables you to print shipping labels for shipments directly within your application easily.","sidebar":"Label"},"label/quickstart":{"id":"label/quickstart","title":"Label API Quickstart","description":"Early Access Program","sidebar":"Label"},"quickstart":{"id":"quickstart","title":"Quickstart","description":"Introduction"},"rate/faq":{"id":"rate/faq","title":"Rate FAQ","description":"Does the rating API return duties (DDU/DDP) information?","sidebar":"Rating"},"rate/how-rates-work":{"id":"rate/how-rates-work","title":"How Rates Work","description":"High-level overview","sidebar":"Rating"},"rate/overview":{"id":"rate/overview","title":"Rating Overview","description":"What are rates?","sidebar":"Rating"},"rate/quickstart":{"id":"rate/quickstart","title":"Rating Quickstart","description":"This document is intended for technical architects and developers that need to integrate with ShipperHQ\u2019s Rates API to build their own integration to retrieve shipment details from ShipperHQ.","sidebar":"Rating"},"sdk-use-cases":{"id":"sdk-use-cases","title":"SDK Use Cases","description":"Overview"},"transclusion/error":{"id":"transclusion/error","title":"error","description":"[//] all the FAQ of all APIs contain this file)"}}}')}}]);
