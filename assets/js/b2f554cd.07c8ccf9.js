This is a three step process:\\n1. Get ShipperHQ API Key\\n2. Get Authentication Code\\n3. Generate a JWT access token (valid 30 days)\\n\\n## Access Scope of the rating API\\n\\nBefore we dig into the specifics, it is important to define the access scope for the API Key, the Authentication Code and the JWT Access Token. Each of these elements are specific to a single ShipperHQ Website.\\n\\nYou can think of a Website as a sale channel for instance an online store in the US (production), an online store in Canada (production) a development store, a CRM sales channel (offline sales).\\n\\nBecause ShipperHQ supports multiple Websites, each Website can have its own Shipping rules. Each Website will, as a consequence, generate different type of rates for the same virtual cart and customer choices.\\n\\nTo reflect this level of functionality, authorization and access to the rating API is specific to a Website: you need a different set of credentials for each ShipperHQ Website. \\n\\nFor more information about ShipperHQ Website, please visit our [customer documentation](https://docs.shipperhq.com/adding-websites-in-shipperhq/).\\n\\n## How to get your API Key (for a single Website)\\n\\nThe API key is accessible on all platforms at all time via ShipperHQ dashboard.\\n\\nTo get the API key:\\n1. Visite the [Websites](https://shipperhq.com/ratesmgr/websites) section of the dashboard.\\n2. Select the Website you want to get the key from\\n3. Select the `API key` and copy it to your application\\n\\n## How to get your Authentication Code (for a single Website)\\n\\n### For new ShipperHQ deployment on manually connected platforms (Magento/Adobe Commerce, Zoey, WooCommerce, etc.)\\nOn these platforms, you can generate yourself a new Authentication Code yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n### For Single Sign On platforms: BigCommerce and Shopify\\n\\n### For existing (in production or in development) ShipperHQ Websites\\n\\n### If unsure: please contact support!\\n\\n\\n## How to generate your JWT Authentication Token (for a single Website)\\n\\nOnce you have your ShipperHQ API Key and ShipperHQ Authentication code, you have to generate a JWT token to access ShipperHQ rating API.\\n\\nUse the following steps to create an Authentication token for testing. You will need to use this same query in your integration to create secret tokens when required, as they expire after 30 days. \\n\\n- Navigate to the ShipperHQ GraphQL playground.\\n- Click Add New in the top left corner. \\n- Set the URL to https://rms.shipperhq.com.\\n- Click the Reload Docs button. \\n- Send a createSecretToken mutation with your API Key and Authentication Code. \\n\\n```json title=\\"Create a secret token\\"\\nmutation CreateSecretToken { \\n   createSecretToken(\\n      api_key: \\"your_api_key\\",\\n      auth_code: \\"your_auth_code\\"\\n      )\\n      { \\n        token \\n      } \\n}\\n```\\n\\n:::tip We use JWT and the token has a 30 days expiration date\\n\\nThe response contains the token you use to make requests to the ShipperHQ API. This token expires every 30 days. You can request a new token up to an hour before your current token expiration date and time. The token is a [JWT token](https://jwt.io/) and they have an expiration timestamp encoded inside: no need to remember the expiration date. We recommend using your favorite [JWT](https://jwt.io/) parsing library to extract the expiration from the token, so you will know the exact second the token expires.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n# Requests\\n## Request Headers\\nAny query or request must include the following headers\\n\\n- `X-ShipperHQ-Secret-Token` \u2013 This is the Secret token you have generated for your ShipperHQ account (see Authentication section)\\n- `X-ShipperHQ-Scope` \u2013 This is the SCOPE from your SHQ account\\n- `X-ShipperHQ-Session` \u2013 This identifies a cart/order, use any unique value\\n\\n# Quickstart \\nThis document is intended for technical architects and developers that need to integrate with ShipperHQ\u2019s Rating API to build their own integration to retrieve shipping rates from ShipperHQ.\\n\\nUse the information outlined in this document to view how custom fields and attributes are queried and modified.\\n\\nNote, this does not document the standard types and fields the API provides. This information is found in the GraphQL schema and obtained via our GraphQL playground. Please refer to the Introduction to GraphQL article from Graphql.org for more information about GraphQL. \\n\\n## GraphQL Ratings API Benefits\\n- Flexibility: The GraphQL Ratings API gives users the ability to access the details used to obtain the shipping rate and query what is most important to you and your business. As such, you can query 5 pieces of information or every possible field as you see fit.\\n- Customization: The GraphQL Ratings API  givesusers the ability to build their own integration into ShipperHQ to retrieve shipping rates. For example, you can use it to get shipping rates into your order processing system or build a custom integration from you eCommerce cart.\\n- Split Shipments: The GraphQL Ratings API enables users to leverage multi-origin fulfillment and split shipping and product groups at checkout. Retrieve tailored shipping rates and methods for each item in the order based on their shipping origin and/or product group! This way, your customer\u2019s order does not have to be limited by the item with the longest shipping time. \\n\\n## Getting Started\\nShipperHQ\u2019s classic rating service provides rating to BigCommerce, Shopify, and Magento eCommerce platforms. The Ratings API uses GraphQL to allow for faster and more efficient API calls and PWA-compatibility.\\n\\nPlease refer to the Introduction to GraphQL article from Graphql.org for more information about GraphQL. \\n\\n## Ratings Workflow\\nShipperHQ can calculate shipping rates based on your shipping strategy. \\n\\nSubmit a request that includes the contents of the cart, like item\u2019s weight, value and quantity and include destination address information \\nCan include any other shipping options required like liftgate,  residential address or specific dates for delivery\\nOur API will return shipping rates for the cart using your ShipperHQ configured rules and carriers\\nDepending on whether you choose to request simple rates or full shipping rates, we can return basic rate information or full details of carriers, shipments, dates and shipping options available.\\n\\n## Retrieving Rating Information\\nYou can retrieve shipping rates by querying the Rating GraphQL API. \\n\\n## GraphQL API URL and Limits\\n- Endpoint URL: The current GraphQL API endpoint is at https://api.shipperhq.com/v2/graphql and all requests must be `HTTP POST` requests with `application/JSON` encoded bodies.\\n- Request Limits:  These queries are subject to your request limits. Please view your request limits on ShipperHQ\u2019s pricing page.\\n- Monitoring Request limits: Review your requests within your ShipperHQ analytics dashboard.\\n\\n## Request Definitions\\nThe ShipperHQ rating API includes the following three queries. \\n\\n| Query                      | Description         |\\n| ---------------------------|---------------------|\\n|`retrieveShippingQuote`     |\\tRetrieve basic shipping rates including carrier and method titles and total shipping charges. |\\n|`retrieveFullShippingQuote`\\t| Retrieve detailed shipping rate information for each shipment, including origin or warehouse information, carrier and method information, freight options available, available dates, in-store pickup information, and more.|\\n|`retrieveUserSettings`|\\tRetrieve merchant\u2019s settings like locale and currency.|\\n\\nYou can view the details of queries/mutations, and their descriptions within the ShipperHQ GraphQL playground. \\n\\nUse your own tool or navigate to ShipperHQ\u2019s playground to view any GraphQL queries. Follow the procedure outlined below to use GraphQL.\\n\\nNavigate to the ShipperHQ GraphQL playground.\\nIn a new GraphQL playground window, enter https://api.shipperhq.com/v2/graphql into the URL.\\n- Click the Docs button.\\n- Click the Reload Docs icon.\\n- Click the Query link to view a list of available queries and the arguments and fields you can include in your request.\\nYou can also view the structure of the ratingInfo required as a parameter in your request.\\n\\n![GraphiQL example](./graphiql-example-2021-08-11_10-20-25.jpeg)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Item Attributes\\nItem attributes in the request allow you to include item-specific values like a shipping group or an origin. They are required if you are using any type of features such as carrier rules, dimensional shipping, multi-origin, etc. The most common attributes are listed below. \\n\\n\\n:::tip Values are case sensitive and require delimiter\\nAll values are case sensitive and require a delimiter between multiple values. The default delimiter is a comma, but if your data is already separated by hashes (#), it is required for you to set the appVersion to 2.0.0 within the siteDetails.\\n\\n:::\\n| Attribute Name | \\tDescription |\\n| -------------- | ------------ |\\n|`shipperhq_shipping_group` | \\tThis is used to place the shipping group on an item to match carrier rules.|\\n|`shipperhq_warehouse`|\\tThis is used if you are using multi-origin functionality in order to specify which origin(s) are applicable for an item. These values are separated by the \u201c#\u2019 character and must match origin names configured in ShipperHQ.|\\n|`shipperhq_dim_group` |\\tThis is used if you have created any dimensional rules for your items to be packed in a specific way.|\\n|`ship_length`, `ship_width`, `ship_height`|\\tThese are used if you are placing dimensions on items; Note, you must include all 3 attributes when using this query.\\n|`ship_separately`|\\tThis allows for the item to be packed separately into its own box when used for rating.|\\n\\n\\n```json title=\\"Attribute example\\"\\n    \\"attributes\\" : [ {\\n        \\"name\\" : \\"shipperhq_shipping_group\\",\\n        \\"value\\" : \\"FLAT59,FREE\\"\\n      }, {\\n        \\"name\\" : \\"ship_width\\",\\n        \\"value\\" : \\"2.0000\\"\\n      }, {\\n        \\"name\\" : \\"ship_length\\",\\n        \\"value\\" : \\"2.0000\\"\\n      }, {\\n        \\"name\\" : \\"ship_height\\",\\n        \\"value\\" : \\"36.0000\\"\\n      }, {\\n        \\"name\\" : \\"shipperhq_dim_group\\",\\n        \\"value\\" : \\"RULE1,RULE2\\"\\n      }, {\\n        \\"name\\" : \\"shipperhq_hs_code\\",\\n        \\"value\\" : \\"123456\\"\\n      }, {\\n        \\"name\\" : \\"shipperhq_warehouse\\",\\n        \\"value\\" : \\"ORIGIN1,ORIGIN2\\"\\n      } ], \\n```\\n\\n## Requested Options\\n\\nRequested Options in the requestedOptions field in the request allow you to include services for the entire shipment such as Liftgate or Residential delivery. These are useful if you are using Freight carriers or small package carriers that offer specific delivery methods for residential delivery. The most common attributes are listed below. \\n\\n| Requested Options  | \\tData Type| \\tDescription |\\n|--------------------|-----------|--------------|\\n|`liftgate_required` |\\tBoolean\\t | This specifies liftgate is required at the destination.  |\\n|`notify_required`  |\\tBoolean\\t   | This requests an appointment delivery or notice of delivery. |\\n| `inside_delivery` |\\tBoolean\\t   | This requests delivery inside the destination. |\\n|`limited_delivery` |\\tBoolean    | \\tThis specifies limited access at the destination address. |\\n|`destination_type` |\\tBoolean |\\tThis specifies if a destination is a Residential or Business address and is used for freight and small package shipments.|\\n\\n:::tip All values are case-sensitive\\n:::\\n\\n\\n```json title=\\"Available options\\"\\nrequestedOptions: {\\n   options: [\\n   {\\n       code: \\"liftgate_required\\",\\n       value:  \\"true\\"\\n   },\\n   {\\n       code: \\"destination_type\\",\\n       value: \\"residential\\"\\n   }]}   \\n```\\n\\n## Preparing Queries in GraphQL Playground\\nUse the following process to use the GraphQL Playground.
